## Features
* ##### Module based  
Every component/system in logic code is built out of modules. You can use existing modules or create your own.  

* ##### Simulation  
Logic code provide the users to simulate the logic circuit but converting the circuit into a c++ code. Which can be compiled to an executable to run the project.

* #####  Support for automatic build  
Not everybody likes C++ and Make. So logic code transpiler take care of Makefile generation and build for you.
